                <p className="">Ari provided my son with exactly the support he needed
                    throughout Year 12. I have no doubt that he would not have been as
                    settled and calm going into his Methods exam without the guidance and
                    support of Ari over the last 6+ months. Ari was always approachable,
                    knowledgeable, friendly and flexible. Cant recommend more highly.
                    Thanks Ari.</p>
